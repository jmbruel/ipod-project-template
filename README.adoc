== Refactoring of an existing code

You are asked to refactor the application you will find on this repo:

https://github.com/codurance/task-list 

TIP: This one you can do in `python` or some other language than Java!

Here are your initial tasks for this project:

[%interactive]
* [ ] Replace this README.adoc so that it contains your report on what you've done to refactor.
* [ ] Explain how to deploy your app (e.g., `mvn install` or `gradle install`)


ifdef::uk[]
== Expected activity

You have up to December 17th, 2020 to improve as much as possible the code of your choosen application :

- New design patterns
- Good practices (e.g., SOLID)

TIP: Start simple, and remember to document in your README.

TIP: To guide you, try to anticipate code evolution.
endif::[]


ifdef::uk[]
== Expected Results

=== GitHub repo

Use this repo to host your code.
You can use branches if you think it is pertinent.

=== UML Models

No models is required nor expected, but if you need some to explain a refactoring, feel free to use them.
They will be appreciated.

=== Expected Delivrables

The entry point of your report is the `README` of the `master` branch.

Mandatory elements:

[%interactive]
* [ ] your name
* [ ] a table of content
une courte explication par chaque fonctionnalité nouvelle ou refactoring précis
avec des extraits de code illustratifs et une justification.
endif::[]


ifdef::uk[]
== Evaluation criteria

You can work in teams of 2 max (but then double work will be expected).

The main criteria for grading will be the following:

- pertinence of the choices
- pertinence of the tests
- overall code quality
- documentation quality (illustration, explainations)
- number and difficulty of the refactoring elements
